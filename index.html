                <h3>5 Stars - <strong>after months of research</strong><blockquote cite="Imre Horvath">

                <p>Can't believe the difference this makes compared to a 50inch Samsung for online multiplayer. I play Cod, Battlefield and Rocket League. The 1ms response is a dream and the 10-11ms input lag is nearly unmatched at any price range and is a must. The speakers lack bass but provide adequate sound gaming late at night. But given if you have this or plan to get it you will probably have a headset anyways. The stock rts1 mode is good given you set your console rgb to full. A tad sharp though. No real downside I could find to not give it 5 stars. Enjoy future buyers. Worth the money if you play online a lot, as I do.</p>

                <h3>5 Stars - <strong>Perfect</strong><blockquote cite="Wil Hanbidge">

                <p>This monitor is gorgeous! It looks really sleek and has really clear colours. The fast refresh rate is perfect for gaming or for videos. It's a nice big screen but I don't think I could use anything any bigger. The monitor is really simple to use so I set it up in the first 30 minutes that I had it with no hassle. It arrived very quickly and was well packaged so I was very impressed. I would definitely recommend this for anyone that wants a high end monitor that is better than almost anything even in higher price ranges. My only hit is that I wish it had 144hz.</p>

                <h3>4 Stars - <strong>Great Monitor. Not so great stand.</strong><blockquote cite="Damon Ford">

                <p>Picture quality is fantastic. Love the Dual HDMI inputs, But the downside to this monitor is the stand, NO adjustability, I will be looking to invest in a VESA compatible stand for it (which at least its compatible with).</p>
